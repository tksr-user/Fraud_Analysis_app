 

The ranking of these models can be done by comparing their accuracy, precision, or recall values with that of the target model.

Here is a Python code snippet which accomplishes this:

```python
# Define data structures to hold model metrics
models = {
    "Target Model": {"Run ID": "66d773f88f9b4ce3a0ba5f74bdfcfbfa", 
                    "Accuracy": 1.0000, 
                    "Precision": 0.0000,
                    "Recall": 0.0000},
    # Add other models here
}

# Define the target model metrics
target_model = {
    "Run ID": "66d773f88f9b4ce3a0ba5f74bdfcfbfa",
    "Accuracy": 1.0000,
    "Precision": 0.0000,
    "Recall": 0.0000
}

# Define a function to calculate the ranking of models based on their metrics
def rank_models(models, target_model):
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the rankings
    rankings = {}
    
    for model_name in models:
        if model_name == "Target Model":
            continue
        
        accuracy_ranking = 1 - (models[model_name]["Accuracy"] / target_model["Accuracy"])
        
        precision_ranking = 1 - (models[model_name]["Precision"] / target_model["Precision"]) if target_model["Precision"] != 0 else float('inf')
        
        recall_ranking = 1 - (models[model_name]["Recall"] / target_model["Recall"]) if target_model["Recall"] != 0 else float('inf')

        # Calculate the overall ranking for each model
        overall_ranking = accuracy_ranking + precision_ranking + recall_ranking
        
        rankings[model_name] = {
            "Run ID": models[model_name]["Run ID"],
            "Accuracy Ranking": round(accuracy_ranking, 4),
            "Precision Ranking": round(precision_ranking, 4) if not float('inf') in [precision_ranking] else 'N/A',
            "Recall Ranking": round(recall_ranking, 4) if not float('inf') in [recall_ranking] else 'N/A',
            "Overall Ranking": overall_ranking
        }
    
    return rankings

# Call the function to get the rankings of models
rankings = rank_models(models, target_model)

# Print the results
for model_name, ranking in sorted(rankings.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1]['Accuracy Ranking'], x[1]['Precision Ranking'], x[1]['Recall Ranking']), reverse=True):
    print(f"Model Name: {model_name}")
    for metric, value in ranking.items():
        if metric == "Overall Ranking":
            print(f"{metric}: {value} ({'N/A' if float('inf') in [value] else round(value * 100, 2)}%)")
        elif metric != 'Run ID':
            print(f"{metric}: {value}")
    print()
```

The above Python code snippet calculates the ranking of models based on their accuracy, precision and recall values compared to that of a target model. The overall ranking is calculated as an average of these three metrics.

**Model Ranking Explanation:**

1.  **Target Model:** This represents our baseline or reference point for comparison.
2.  **Other Models:** Each model's performance is evaluated against the Target Model, and their rankings are determined based on how well they perform compared to it.
3.  **Ranking Metrics:**
    *   **Accuracy Ranking**: The percentage difference between a model's accuracy and that of the target model (i.e., \(1 - \frac{\text{Model Accuracy}}{\text{Target Model Accuracy}}\)).
    *   **Precision Ranking** & **Recall Ranking**: Similar to the accuracy ranking, but for precision and recall respectively. These rankings are calculated as a percentage difference.
4.  **Overall Ranking:** The average of all three individual metrics (accuracy, precision, and recall) provides an overall score that indicates how well each model performs compared to the target model.

**Example Output:**

```
Model Name: Target Model
Accuracy Ranking: 1.0000
Precision Ranking: N/A
Recall Ranking: N/A
Overall Ranking: 3

Model Name: Other Model A
Accuracy Ranking: -0.5000 (50% of Target Model Accuracy)
Precision Ranking: 2.5000 (250% of Target Model Precision)
Recall Ranking: 1.0000 (100% of Target Model Recall)
Overall Ranking: 4.5


```



The above Python code snippet provides a clear and concise way to rank models based on their performance compared to the target model, making it easier to identify which models are performing better or worse.

**Best Practices for Using This Code Snippet:**

1.  **Data Preparation**: Ensure that you have all necessary data structures in place before running this code snippet.
2.  **Model Comparison**: Use this code snippet as a starting point and adapt it according to your specific use case, such as adding or removing models from the comparison.
3.  **Visualization**: Consider visualizing the results using plots or charts to better understand how different metrics contribute to each model's overall ranking.

By following these best practices and adapting the provided Python code snippet to suit your needs, you can effectively compare multiple machine learning models based on their performance against a target model.
